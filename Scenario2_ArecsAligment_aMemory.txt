Rain whispers softly onto dark cobblestones, glinting faintly beneath lanterns guttering weakly in the storm. Teide stands cloaked in shadow, hood drawn low, his longbow gently held at his side. His eyes pierce the gloom, locked onto a distant figure, oblivious in the downpour. He is utterly still, breathing slow and controlled, merging seamlessly into the night.

The figure shifts slightly, unaware of his impending fate. Teide waits patiently, allowing the rain to drench him thoroughly, droplets cascading from the edges of his hood, dripping steadily onto the ground below. Thunder rumbles softly in the distance, a gentle reminder of the storm’s quiet wrath. Teide lifts his face slightly, sensing the moment drawing closer.

The faint rhythm of Peter Gabriel's voice drifts gently through the air, mingling with the whisper of rainfall. Teide breathes in slowly, raising the bow with practiced grace, smoothly nocking an arrow. The music swells; a single heartbeat passes before the arrow sings through the night, silently stealing life from the shadowed figure. Teide moves swiftly forward, vanishing into the deeper darkness.

He crosses swiftly and soundlessly, his cloak billowing gently behind him, droplets trailing through the air. Approaching the grand mansion, he expertly navigates past ornate fountains and perfectly manicured gardens now sodden and slick from the rain. He pauses briefly at a heavy wooden door etched with elegant carvings, slipping a thin blade into the lock, twisting deftly until it yields silently beneath his skilled fingers.

Inside, the atmosphere is heavy, lit by flickering lamplight casting long, twisting shadows along the hallways lined with marble pillars. Guards pace inattentively, unaware of the silent predator that has entered their domain. Teide pauses again, studying their patterns, eyes sharp and calculating beneath his hood. He waits for the perfect moment before moving with lethal precision.

Twin daggers flash from beneath his cloak as Teide moves fluidly, dancing between shadows. His blades whisper death, swift and precise, leaving only muffled cries and bodies crumpling silently to polished marble floors. He presses forward methodically, ascending a grand staircase, dagger edges glinting softly in the dim glow, footsteps soft and deliberate.

Teide halts momentarily at the top of the staircase, observing the intricate layout of the upper hall. The grandeur of the mansion is evident; tapestries rich with history line the walls, ornate sculptures and priceless vases rest upon polished stands. The elegance contrasts starkly with the brutal purpose of his visit. He continues, slipping silently into side rooms, dispatching guards with swift, practiced efficiency, each strike calculated, each movement graceful yet lethal.

In the shadows of one lavish chamber, Teide pauses before an antique mirror. Briefly, his reflection meets him, cold and detached beneath the hood. He stands there for a lingering moment, chest rising slowly and evenly with each controlled breath. His cloak hangs heavy and drenched from his shoulders, water running steadily down its length, mingling with the blood dripping softly from his daggers. Droplets strike the polished floor beneath him, creating delicate crimson patterns, mesmerizing yet chillingly beautiful. His stance is straight and disciplined, the bow securely strapped across his back, daggers clenched tightly in his hands. He raises his gaze again, meeting his own reflection squarely. His face is dark, his features sharp and resolute, eyes calm yet devoid of warmth. He is neither good nor evil—just a man shaped irreversibly by tragedy and necessity, a systematic embodiment of lethal precision. There is no sadness in his expression, only a hard, quiet acceptance. A heartbeat passes, and he finally breaks the gaze, resolve steeling his heart for what must come next.

*The music shifts, intimate, haunting—"Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth, tugging at the darkness, word upon word…"*

In another place entirely, lit only by faint candlelight, Arec sits alone. Darkness coils around her, tendrils pulsing in shades of red and black. She chants quietly from ancient scrolls, trembling hands placing a medallion and familiar trinkets into a velvet box, tears silently tracing paths down her face. Memories flood her mind—she recalls a gentle kiss, happier times, a warmth now lost to the merciless void.

The estate returns. Teide leaves the mirror and steps back into the hallway, immediately confronted by more guards drawn by the subtle whispers of disturbance. He dispatches them swiftly, blades dancing elegantly, a silent whirlwind of violence that leaves no survivors. Approaching the far end of the corridor, Teide slows slightly, sensing a presence far more formidable ahead.

A figure emerges from the shadows before the imposing double doors, blocking his path. The man facing Teide stands as still and composed as he himself does. Their eyes meet, two reflections in an invisible mirror—similar yet distinct. They recognize each other instantly—not as friends, not as enemies, merely as souls cut from the same cloth. Their paths diverged long ago, leading to this inevitable confrontation. No words are exchanged; none are necessary. They both understand the silent truth.

Their battle begins quietly, blades whispering softly through the air, swift and controlled. Each man matches the other's moves perfectly, evenly matched in grace, skill, and resolve. Neither combatant shows hate or fear, just cold acceptance, understanding this encounter can have only one outcome. But life has subtle ways of distinguishing one soul from another—a missed heartbeat, a fraction of hesitation born from lessons learned differently, experiences shaped uniquely by fate. Teide’s opponent falters slightly, a tiny miscalculation, yet enough to disrupt the delicate balance of their deadly dance. Realization flashes briefly across the man's eyes, replaced swiftly by pain and quiet disappointment as Teide’s blades find their mark. He falls gracefully, dignity preserved even in defeat. Teide catches him gently, easing him softly onto the cold marble, allowing his end to come as comfortably as possible. In these final moments, their eyes exchange mutual respect. Teide places a comforting hand on the man’s chest, whispering quietly—an acknowledgment of the honorable path he too could have walked.

The glowing symbol upon Teide’s cloak pulses gently, shielding him as he moves toward the imposing double doors ahead. He pauses, then kicks them open. Inside, a nobleman cowers alone, terror etched into his features.

Teide remains motionless, eyes cold beneath his hood. Behind him, footsteps echo softly; Arec steps forward, magic crackling around her fingertips, eyes blazing with fury and heartbreak. She reaches the noble swiftly, grabbing his chin roughly and whispering into his ear—a silent sentence of judgment.

*The music crescendos: "I'm with the father, he's out in the boat, riding the water, riding the waves on the sea*." A vision flashes—Henry, standing uncertainly on a small boat, drifting into the misty unknown guided by Death itself.

Returning sharply, the nobleman's face ages in seconds, flesh melting to bone, bone crumbling to dust. Arec sobs violently, now clutching only his skull. She falls, spent, but Teide swiftly gathers her in his arms, pulling her away as the music fades, leaving only her screams echoing against the stone walls.

As darkness claims the scene, all that remains are the echoes—the anguish, the rage, the unbearable weight of loss.
