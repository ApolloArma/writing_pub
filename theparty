hadows of one lavish chamber, Teide pauses before an antique mirror. Briefly, his reflection meets him, cold and detached beneath the hood. He stands there for a lingering moment, chest rising slowly and evenly with each controlled breath. His cloak hangs heavy and drenched from his shoulders, water running steadily down its length, mingling with the blood dripping softly from his daggers. Droplets strike the polished floor beneath him, creating delicate crimson patterns, mesmerizing yet chillingly beautiful. His stance is straight and disciplined, the bow securely strapped across his back, daggers clenched tightly in his hands. He raises his gaze again, meeting his own reflection squarely. His face is dark, his features sharp and resolute, eyes calm yet devoid of warmth. He is neither good nor evil—just a man shaped irreversibly by tragedy and necessity, a systematic embodiment of lethal precision. There is no sadness in his expression, only a hard, quiet acceptance. A heartbeat passes, and he finally breaks the gaze, resolve steeling his heart for what must come next.

The music shifts, intimate, haunting—"Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth, tugging at the darkness, word upon word…"

In another place entirely, lit only by faint candlelight, Arec sits alone. Darkness coils around her, tendrils pulsing in shades of red and black. She chants quietly from ancient scrolls, trembling hands placing a medallion and familiar trinkets into a velvet box, tears silently tracing paths down her face. Memories flood her mind—she recalls a gentle kiss, happier times, a warmth now lost to the merciless void.

The estate returns. Teide leaves the mirror and steps back into the hallway, immediately confronted by more guards drawn by the subtle whispers of disturbance. He dispatches them swiftly, blades dancing elegantly, a silent whirlwind of violence that leaves no survivors. Approaching the far end of the corridor, Teide slows slightly, sensing a presence far more formidable ahead.

A figure emerges from the shadows before the imposing double doors, blocking his path. The man facing Teide stands as still and composed as he himself does. Their eyes meet, two reflections in an invisible mirror—similar yet distinct. They recognize each other instantly—not as friends, not as enemies, merely as souls cut from the same cloth. Their paths diverged long ago, leading to this inevitable confrontation. No words are exchanged; none are necessary. They both understand the silent truth.

Their battle begins quietly, blades whispering softly through the air, swift and controlled. Each man matches the other's moves perfectly, evenly matched in grace, skill, and resolve. Neither combatant shows hate or fear, just cold acceptance, understanding this encounter can have only one outcome. But life has subtle ways of distinguishing one soul from another—a missed heartbeat, a fraction of hesitation born from lessons learned differently, experiences shaped uniquely by fate. Teide's opponent falters slightly, a tiny miscalculation, yet enough to disrupt the delicate balance of their deadly dance. Realization flashes briefly across the man's eyes, replaced swiftly by pain and quiet disappointment as Teide's blades find their mark. He falls gracefully, dignity preserved even in defeat. Teide catches him gently, easing him softly onto the cold marble, allowing his end to come as comfortably as possible. In these final moments, their eyes exchange mutual respect. Teide places a comforting hand on the man's chest, whispering quietly—an acknowledgment of the honorable path he too could have walked.

The glowing symbol upon Teide's cloak pulses gently, shielding him as he moves toward the imposing double doors ahead. He pauses, then kicks them open. Inside, a nobleman cowers alone, terror etched into his features.

Teide remains motionless, eyes cold beneath his hood. Behind him, footsteps echo softly; Arec steps forward, magic crackling around her fingertips, eyes blazing with fury and heartbreak. She reaches the noble swiftly, grabbing his chin roughly and whispering into his ear—a silent sentence of judgment.

The music crescendos: "I'm with the father, he's out in the boat, riding the water, riding the waves on the sea." A vision flashes—Henry, her husband, standing uncertainly on a small boat, drifting into the misty unknown guided by Death itself. (The music fades, all is momentarily silent)

Returning sharply, the nobleman ages in seconds, flesh melting to bone, bone crumbling to the ground. Arec sobs violently, clutching his bare skull. She falls, spent, but Teide swiftly gathers her in his arms, carrying her away, leaving only her screams echoing against the stone walls as she smashes the skull to the floor.

As darkness claims the memory, all that remains are the echoes—the anguish, the rage, the unbearable weight of loss.

We return to the campsite.

Teide’s face is just as it was before—still, unreadable, but carrying the same quiet gravity. The fire crackles faintly beside him.

Arec looks at him, and she knows. He remembers. He understands.

The pain hasn’t left her—it has only found a place to rest.

She moves slowly, as if gravity itself has deepened around her. Knees folding, cloak dragging, she lowers herself beside Ruddish—silent, enormous, immovable.

One hand touches the earth—seeking steadiness.
The other lifts, falters… stifles a sob she cannot let break.

Without a word, Ruddish shifts beside her. His massive frame leans ever so slightly, and his thick arm reaches around her shoulders with surprising gentleness. It isn't awkward or clumsy—just present. Strong. Reassuring.

He doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.

Because even if he doesn’t understand the reason behind her sorrow, he feels its weight.
And offers his strength to carry it—quietly, patiently, without condition.

Arec leans into the nook of his arm, her body yielding to the warmth and quiet solidity he offers. Her eyes, glassy with the remnants of pain, lift slowly to meet his.

She gives him a small, trembling smile.

"It's okay, Ruddish," she whispers, the words catching in her throat. "It's over now."

But she’s not speaking of the merchant. Not really.

She’s speaking to herself.

Ruddish watches her a moment longer, his brow furrowed—not with confusion, but with a quiet understanding that runs deeper than words.

Then, as if unprompted, his low voice breaks the stillness.

"He knew you were coming," he says.

Arec stiffens slightly. Her eyes search his face, unsure whether he’s speaking of the merchant… or of something far older.

Teide’s gaze shifts, focused now not on Arec, but on Ruddish.

El'roso does look up—slowly, deliberately.

His gaze lingers on Ruddish, thoughtful and sharp. For a moment, something unreadable flickers behind his eyes—not alarm, not confusion. Just quiet confirmation. As if watching an ember that he knew would catch flame.

He closes the book—not loudly, not theatrically, just enough to mark the moment. His hand rests over it, fingers still.

For once, he does not comment. Does not smirk. Does not move on.

He simply watches.

Then, as if shaking off a thought he doesn’t want to entertain just yet, El'roso exhales lightly through his nose.

"Someone should do something about the corpse," he mutters, rising to his feet and brushing off his robe with deliberate indifference.

But the way he glances once more at Ruddish—quick, thoughtful, measuring—betrays the curiosity still burning quietly behind his eyes.

"I'll take care of the body," Teide says quietly, rising to his feet without ceremony. His voice carries no emotion—just a sense of responsibility. Of completion.

He glances toward Ruddish.

"Give me a hand, would you?"

Ruddish nods and rises, the firelight catching along the worn edges of his armor as he moves. There’s no need for explanation—just action. As if the weight of the task fits easily in hands that have carried much heavier things.

Arec watches them go, then lets her gaze drift back toward El’roso.

He stands a short distance away, facing the darkness beyond the firelight. His back is to them all—deliberate.

She narrows her eyes.

He’s hiding something.

She knows it.

And for now, so does he.
