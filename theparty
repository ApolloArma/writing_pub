The party has made camp after a long day of travel. Arec is tending to Rudish, who sustained a few minor injuries during a skirmish earlier. As the fire crackles, she methodically wraps his arm, her movements efficient but careful. El'roso is nearby, flipping through his spellbook, while Teide keeps watch from a distance.

Suddenly, an injured merchant stumbles into the clearing, clearly desperate. He's clutching his side, blood trickling down his face. He collapses just at the edge of their camp, gasping for help.

“Please... someone... bandits attacked... I need help...” the merchant pleads.

Rudish and El'roso both glance up, but neither move to assist. Arec looks up from her work on Rudish's arm, her eyes narrowing slightly. She glances towards Teide, her expression unreadable, but the slight raise of her eyebrow conveys her thoughts.

Teide, picking up on the subtle signal, steps forward, his eyes assessing the situation. He crouches beside the merchant, giving him a once-over, and then turns back towards Arec, meeting her gaze.

“He doesn't seem like a threat, Arec. But it could be a trap. Could also be useful if he knows the area or has information.” Teide says, his eyes fixed on the stranger with that sharp, clinical calm that always seems one step ahead of violence.

Arec looks at the merchant again, her gaze cool but not entirely unkind. She finishes tying off Rudish's bandage and gives his shoulder a reassuring pat.

“There, that should hold. Now try not to move too much, alright?” Arec says softly to Ruddish, her voice low and reassuring.

Rudish nods, his eyes briefly meeting hers. "Thanks, Arec," he mutters, his tone gruff but appreciative. He shifts slightly, wincing as the bandage pulls on his skin.

Arec stands, her focus shifting back to the merchant. She approaches slowly, her eyes still on Teide, looking for any sign of hesitation or concern. Teide gives her a small nod, signaling his approval.

“You're lucky my friend here thinks you might be worth helping,” Arec says, her voice measured as she kneels beside the merchant. Her hands begin to glow faintly as she starts to heal his wounds. “But this isn't a place to linger. Rest, recover—and then be on your way.”

The merchant, gasping in relief as the pain begins to fade, nods quickly. "Thank you... thank you, I understand."

Arec works quickly, her hands moving with precision. Though her demeanor remains guarded, there's a practiced care in her touch that speaks of her nurturing side. Still, a thought needles at her: the merchant’s wounds, while painful, weren’t life-threatening. And what were the odds he’d stumble across them out here, in the dark? Most would’ve avoided strangers by the fire—kept to the trees, or waited for morning. She finishes and stands, giving Teide a quick look.

“He can stay until he can walk, but no longer. Keep an eye on him, Teide,” Arec says, though her gaze lingers on the merchant with a trace of unease—still unsure if she’s made the right call. “It shouldn’t take long,” she adds, quieter, almost to herself.

Teide nods, his expression serious. “Understood. I’ll keep him in sight.”

Arec returns to Rudish, her demeanor softening as she sits back down beside him.

“Now, let's make sure you're comfortable. You've had enough excitement for one day,” Arec says gently, her hand returning to adjust the blanket draped over Ruddish's legs.

Rudish gives a faint smile, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards. "You always say that," he grumbles, but there's warmth in his tone.

“And yet, you never listen,” Arec says with a smirk, her tone teasing but gentle as she brushes a bit of dirt from Ruddish’s armor.

With Arec back by Ruddish's side, Teide turns his full attention to the merchant, who is now lying on his side, seemingly exhausted. Teide squats down next to him, his eyes scrutinizing every detail of the man's attire and demeanor.

“You said bandits attacked you. Where was this?” Teide asks, his tone flat but attentive, already listening for the inconsistencies.

The merchant, still dazed, looks up at Teide, blinking as he tries to gather his thoughts. "A... a few miles south, near the old mill. They took everything—my cart, my goods. I barely made it out alive."

Teide nods slowly, his eyes narrowing slightly. He looks over at El'roso, who hasn't moved from his position, seemingly disinterested in the exchange. Then Teide glances towards Arec, who gives him a subtle nod of approval. She trusts his judgment, but he knows she values their safety above all.

“Alright, you can rest here until you're able to move,” Teide says, exhaling through his nose. “But do not cast a shadow.” His tone remains calm—but there’s no mistaking the blade of warning beneath it.

The merchant nods weakly, his eyes wide. "I swear, I won't be in your way. I just... need a little time."

Teide stands up and gestures for the merchant to sit closer to the fire. "Stay where I can see you," he says, his tone softer but still firm. He then takes a seat across from the merchant, keeping his bow within arm's reach.

Teide glances at Arec, then back at the merchant. “You’re lucky. She’s the only one here who’d patch up a stranger.” A beat passes, and he doesn’t even look at El’roso. “Others, not so likely.”

The merchant shivers slightly, his gaze flicking between the two who haven’t spoken—a silent, watchful mountain of muscle and a distant wizard buried in his spellbook. To any outsider, the silence alone would weigh heavier than a spoken warning.

Merchant: "I... I'm grateful. Truly. I won't forget this."

Teide leans back, his eyes never leaving the merchant. "Good. Just remember, gratitude doesn't buy you trust. You rest, and by morning, you'd better be ready to move on."

The merchant nods, his body visibly relaxing as he leans closer to the warmth of the fire. Teide watches him for a moment longer before shifting his gaze to the surrounding darkness.

The night progresses, and the merchant now settled down by the fire, eating some rations Teide reluctantly handed him. As the merchant regains some of his composure, Teide begins to subtly interrogate him, his questions seemingly casual but calculated.

"So, what were you doing out here alone? Not the safest route for a merchant." said Teide.

"I was transporting some goods. Took a shortcut through the old roads. I didn't think bandits would be this far out." says the Merchant, now warmed up and less pitiful in his demeanor.

Teide nods, his expression neutral. "What kind of goods? Anything worth much?"

The merchant shifts slightly, looking into the fire. "Mostly supplies... some fabrics, spices. Nothing too valuable, really."

Teide continues, his eyes fixed on the merchant. "And where were you headed?"

"To Black..." He catches himself, his eyes widening slightly as he realizes that what he was about to say might have been a mistake, not knowing enough about the group's intentions or motives.

Teide's gaze sharpens. "Black?" he prompts, his voice deceptively calm. "Go on. Where exactly were you headed?"

The merchant swallows, visibly nervous now. "I mean... I was... it was just a place nearby. Not important."

Teide leans in, his eyes locking onto the merchant's. "Nearby?" he sighs sarcastically, as if disappointed in the merchant's lack of self-preservation. "There aren't many places around here that start with 'Black.' You mean Black Hollow, don't you?"

The merchant's face pales, and he stammers, "No... no, it's not like that. I just... I made some deliveries there, but I'm not affiliated, not to anyone of them, I swear!"

Teide's expression hardens, and the atmosphere around the campfire shifts. Arec looks up, exchanging a concerned look with Teide. Rudish, sensing the tension, straightens slightly, his gaze moving to El'roso as if awaiting a command.

Arec sends an empathetic, concerned look towards the merchant, then glances at El'roso, noticing how Rudish has entered a familiar state of readiness.

Teide, apathetic yet acknowledging the situation, doesn't answer immediately, his eyes still fixed on the merchant. Finally, he says what needs to be said, "He knows too much. If he frequents Black Hollow, he could at some point run his mouth, we don't know him, this is a bad situation you've got yourself into my friend."

The merchant raises his hands defensively. "Please! I won't say anything. I didn't mean to... I just..."

The merchant barely finishes his plea before the air hums.

A single arcane syllable slips from El'roso's lips—too quiet to be called a word, too precise to be accidental.

A sharp pulse of violet light snaps from his fingers—fast, focused, a jagged streak that lances through the air and strikes the merchant square in the chest, as if aimed straight at his heart.

"Wait!" Arec's voice cracks as she steps forward—half a heartbeat too late.

The man stiffens. His breath catches—

—and then his body seizes, limbs jerking unnaturally as a thin arc of pale blue energy laces across his chest like lightning.

A flash—brief, silent—and he crumples, lifeless, eyes wide, smoke curling faintly from his mouth.

The silence that follows is deep and final.

"You could have let us handle it differently—" she begins, but something in her voice falters mid-sentence.

Her words come out softer than intended, like she's not speaking to him at all.

She's speaking to herself.

Her eyes flicker to the body, then downward—remembering the place where she once stood proud and virtuous, sat upon that tall white horse she dismounted long ago and set loose into the dark. Shame rises—not for what was done here, but for daring to pretend she should be the one to judge it. No longer does she deserve to carry the righteous voice.

From behind her, El'roso shrugs.

"I could've done a lot of things."

But his voice is distant now. So is the wind. So is the world.

Her stare goes hollow—thousand miles deep—and falls to Teide.

He hasn't flinched. His eyes are on her, steady.

Not judging. Not comforting.

Just… knowing. And ready. As if her reaction might break her, and he'll be there to catch what falls. Because he remembers. Because he was there.

That's all it takes.

[In a "filamtized" version of this story the song "Mercy Street by Peter Gabriel would fade in now". The music will be in the foreground, other sounds are muffled in the background]

The sound of the world fades. The color drains. 

We begin to hear the first drops of rain.

The sound becomes the bridge—not only into memory, but into Teide's memory.

The rain whispers softly onto dark cobblestones, glinting faintly beneath lanterns guttering weakly in the storm. Teide stands cloaked in shadow, hood drawn low, his longbow gently held at his side. His eyes pierce the gloom, locked onto a distant figure, oblivious in the downpour. He is utterly still, breathing slow and controlled, merging seamlessly into the night.

The figure shifts slightly, unaware of his impending fate. Teide waits patiently, allowing the rain to drench him thoroughly, droplets cascading from the edges of his hood, dripping steadily onto the ground below. Thunder rumbles softly in the distance, a gentle reminder of the storm's quiet wrath. Teide lifts his face slightly, sensing the moment drawing closer.

["Looking down on empty streets..."]

Teide breathes in slowly, raising the bow with practiced grace, smoothly nocking an arrow. A single heartbeat passes before the arrow sings through the night, silently stealing life from the shadowed figure. Teide moves swiftly forward, vanishing into the deeper darkness.

He crosses swiftly and soundlessly, his cloak billowing gently behind him, droplets trailing through the air. Approaching the grand mansion, he expertly navigates past ornate fountains and perfectly manicured gardens now sodden and slick from the rain. He pauses briefly at a heavy wooden door etched with elegant carvings, slipping a thin blade into the lock, twisting deftly until it yields silently beneath his skilled fingers.

["No where in the corridors..."]

Inside, the atmosphere is heavy, lit by flickering lamplight casting long, twisting shadows along the hallways lined with marble pillars. Guards pace inattentively, unaware of the silent predator that has entered their domain. Teide pauses again, studying their patterns, eyes sharp and calculating beneath his hood. He waits for the perfect moment before moving with lethal precision.

["Dreaming of Mercy Street..."]

Twin daggers flash from beneath his cloak as Teide moves fluidly, dancing between shadows. His blades whisper death, swift and precise, leaving only muffled cries and bodies crumpling silently to polished marble floors. He presses forward methodically, ascending a grand staircase, dagger edges glinting softly in the dim glow, footsteps soft and deliberate.

Teide halts momentarily at the top of the staircase, observing the intricate layout of the upper hall. The grandeur of the mansion is evident; tapestries rich with history line the walls, ornate sculptures and priceless vases rest upon polished stands. The elegance contrasts starkly with the brutal purpose of his visit. He continues, slipping silently into side rooms, dispatching guards with swift, practiced efficiency, each strike calculated, each movement graceful yet lethal.

["In your daddy's arms -> Bridge]

In the shadows of one lavish chamber, Teide pauses before an antique mirror. Briefly, his reflection meets him, cold and detached beneath the hood. He stands there for a lingering moment, chest rising slowly and evenly with each controlled breath. His cloak hangs heavy and drenched from his shoulders, water running steadily down its length, mingling with the blood dripping softly from his daggers. Droplets strike the polished floor beneath him, creating delicate crimson patterns, mesmerizing yet chillingly beautiful. His stance is straight and disciplined, the bow securely strapped across his back, daggers clenched tightly in his hands. 

["Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth"]

In another place entirely, lit only by faint candlelight, Arec sits alone. Darkness coils around her, tendrils pulsing in shades of red and black. She chants quietly from ancient scrolls, trembling hands placing a medallion and familiar trinkets into a velvet box, tears silently tracing paths down her face. Memories flood her mind—she recalls a gentle kiss, happier times, a warmth now lost to the merciless void.

["Dreaming of Mercy Street"]

The estate returns. Teide leaves the mirror and steps back into the hallway, immediately confronted by more guards drawn by the subtle whispers of disturbance. He dispatches them swiftly, blades dancing elegantly, a silent whirlwind of violence that leaves no survivors. Approaching the far end of the corridor, Teide slows slightly, sensing a presence far more formidable ahead.

["Dreaming of Mercy Street"]

A figure emerges from the shadows before the imposing double doors, blocking his path. The man facing Teide stands as still and composed as he himself does. Their eyes meet, two reflections in an invisible mirror—similar yet distinct. They recognize each other instantly—not as friends, not as enemies, merely as souls cut from the same cloth. Their paths diverged long ago, leading to this inevitable confrontation. No words are exchanged; none are necessary. They both understand the silent truth.

[Synthesizer/Piano starts in Bridge]

Their battle begins quietly, blades whispering softly through the air, swift and controlled. Each man matches the other's moves perfectly, evenly matched in grace, skill, and resolve. Neither combatant shows hate or fear, just cold acceptance, understanding this encounter can have only one outcome. But life has subtle ways of distinguishing one soul from another—a missed heartbeat, a fraction of hesitation born from lessons learned differently, experiences shaped uniquely by fate. Teide's opponent falters slightly, a tiny miscalculation, yet enough to disrupt the delicate balance of their deadly dance. Realization flashes briefly across the man's eyes, replaced swiftly by pain and quiet disappointment as Teide's blades find their mark. He falls gracefully, dignity preserved even in defeat. Teide catches him gently, easing him softly onto the cold marble, allowing his end to come as comfortably as possible. In these final moments, their eyes exchange mutual respect. Teide places a comforting hand on the man's chest, whispering quietly—an acknowledgment of the honorable path he too could have walked.

The glowing symbol upon Teide's cloak pulses gently, shielding him as he moves toward the imposing double doors ahead. He pauses, then kicks them open. Inside, a nobleman cowers alone, terror etched into his features.

Teide remains motionless, eyes cold beneath his hood. Behind him, footsteps echo softly; Arec steps forward, magic crackling around her fingertips, eyes blazing with fury and heartbreak. She reaches the noble swiftly, grabbing his chin roughly and whispering into his ear—a silent sentence of judgment.

["I'm with the father, he's out in the boat"] 

A vision flashes—Henry, her husband, standing uncertainly on a small boat, drifting into the misty unknown guided by Death itself.

["Fadeout"]

Returning sharply, the nobleman ages in seconds, flesh melting to bones that crumble to the hard stone floor. Arec sobs violently, still clutching his bare skull. She falls, spent, but Teide swiftly gathers her in his arms and carries her away, leaving only the sound of her screams echoing against the stone walls as she smashes the skull to the ground.

As darkness claims the scene, all that remains are the echoes—the anguish, the rage, the unbearable weight of loss.

We return to the campsite.

Teide’s face is just as it was before—still, unreadable, but carrying the same quiet gravity. The fire crackles faintly beside him.

Arec looks at him, and she knows. He remembers. He understands.

The pain hasn’t left her—it has only found a place to rest.

She moves slowly, as if gravity itself has deepened around her. Knees folding, cloak dragging, she lowers herself beside Ruddish—silent, enormous, immovable.

One hand touches the earth—seeking steadiness. The other lifts, falters… stifles a sob she cannot let break.

Without a word, Ruddish shifts beside her. His massive frame leans ever so slightly, and his thick arm reaches around her shoulders with surprising gentleness. It isn't awkward or clumsy—just present. Strong. Reassuring.

He doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.

Because even if couldn't understood the reason behind her sorrow, he feels its weight. And offers his strength to carry it—quietly, patiently, without condition.

Arec leans into the nook of his arm, her body yielding to the warmth and quiet solidity he offers. Her eyes, glassy with the remnants of pain, lift slowly to meet his.

She gives him a small, trembling smile.

"It's okay, Ruddish," she whispers, the words catching in her throat. "It's over now."

But she’s not speaking of the merchant. Not really.

She’s speaking to herself.

Ruddish watches her a moment longer, his brow furrowed—not with confusion, but with a quiet understanding that runs deeper than words.

Then, as if unprompted, his low voice breaks the stillness.

"He knew you were coming," he says, as if to calm Arec.

Arec stiffens slightly. Her eyes search his face, unsure whether he’s speaking of the merchant… or of something far older.

Teide’s gaze shifts, focused now not on Arec, but on Ruddish.

El'roso does look up—slowly, deliberately.

His gaze lingers on Ruddish, thoughtful and sharp. For a moment, something unreadable flickers behind his eyes—not alarm, not confusion. Just quiet confirmation. As if watching an ember that he knew would catch flame.

He closes the book—not loudly, not theatrically, just enough to mark the moment. His hand rests over it, fingers still.

For once, he does not comment. Does not smirk. Does not move on.

He simply watches.

Then, as if shaking off a thought he doesn’t want to entertain just yet, El'roso exhales lightly through his nose.

"Someone should do something about the corpse," he mutters, rising to his feet and brushing off his robe with deliberate indifference.

But the way he glances once more at Ruddish—quick, thoughtful, measuring—betrays the curiosity still burning quietly behind his eyes.

"I'll take care of the body," Teide says quietly, rising to his feet without ceremony. His voice carries no emotion—just a sense of responsibility. Of completion.

He glances toward Ruddish.

"Give me a hand, would you?"

Ruddish nods and rises, the firelight catching along the worn edges of his armor as he moves. There’s no need for explanation—just action. As if the weight of the task fits easily in hands that have carried much heavier things. He carefully unlocks his embrace of Arec before he goes to help.

Now sitting alone—Arec watches them go, then lets her gaze drift back toward El’roso.

He stands a short distance away, facing the darkness beyond the firelight. His back is to them all—deliberate.

She narrows her eyes.

He’s also hiding something.

She knows it.

And for now, so does he.
