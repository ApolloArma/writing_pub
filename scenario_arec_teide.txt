### Scenario: An Injured Merchant Seeking Help

The party has made camp after a long day of travel. Arec is tending to Rudish, who sustained a few minor injuries during a skirmish earlier. As the fire crackles, she methodically wraps his arm, her movements efficient but careful. El'roso is nearby, flipping through his spellbook, while Teide keeps watch from a distance.

Suddenly, an injured merchant stumbles into the clearing, clearly desperate. H*e’s* clutching his side, blood trickling down his face. He collapses just at the edge of their camp, gasping for help.

**Merchant**: "Please... someone... bandits attacked... I need help..."

Rudish and El'roso both glance up, but neither move to assist. Arec looks up from her work on Rudish's arm, her eyes narrowing slightly. She glances towards Teide, her expression unreadable, but the slight raise of her eyebrow conveys her thoughts.

Teide, picking up on the subtle signal, steps forward, his eyes assessing the situation. He crouches beside the merchant, giving him a once-over, and then turns back towards Arec, meeting her gaze.

**Teide**: "He doesn’t seem like a threat, Arec. But it could be a trap. Could also be useful if he knows the area or has information."

Arec looks at the merchant again, her gaze cool but not entirely unkind. She finishes tying off Rudish's bandage and gives his shoulder a reassuring pat.

**Arec** (softly, to Rudish): "There, that should hold. Now try not to move too much, alright?"

Rudish nods, his eyes briefly meeting hers. "Thanks, Arec," he mutters, his tone gruff but appreciative. He shifts slightly, wincing as the bandage pulls on his skin.

Arec stands, her focus shifting back to the merchant. She approaches slowly, her eyes still on Teide, looking for any sign of hesitation or concern. Teide gives her a small nod, signaling his approval.

**Arec** (to the merchant, her tone measured): "You're lucky my friend here thinks you might be worth helping." She kneels beside the merchant, her hands beginning to glow faintly as she starts to heal his wounds. "But listen closely—you get your help, and then you leave. We have our own to protect, and you’re not one of us. Understand?"

The merchant, gasping in relief as the pain begins to fade, nods quickly. "Thank you... thank you, I understand."

Arec works quickly, her hands moving with precision. Though her demeanor remains guarded, there’s a practiced care in her touch that speaks of her nurturing side. She finishes and stands, giving Teide a quick look.

**Arec**: "He can stay until he can walk, but no longer. Keep an eye on him, Teide."

Teide nods, his expression serious. "Got it. I'll make sure he doesn't do anything stupid."

Arec returns to Rudish, her demeanor softening as she sits back down beside him.

**Arec** (to Rudish, her voice gentle again): "Now, let’s make sure you’re comfortable. You've had enough excitement for one day."

Rudish gives a faint smile, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards. "You always say that," he grumbles, but there’s warmth in his tone.

**Arec** (with a smirk): "And yet, you never listen."

With Arec back by Rudish’s side, Teide turns his full attention to the merchant, who is now lying on his side, clearly exhausted. Teide squats down next to him, his eyes scrutinizing every detail of the man's attire and demeanor.

Teide: "You said bandits attacked you. Where was this?"

The merchant, still dazed, looks up at Teide, blinking as he tries to gather his thoughts. "A... a few miles south, near the old mill. They took everything—my cart, my goods. I barely made it out alive."

Teide nods slowly, his eyes narrowing slightly. He looks over at El'roso, who hasn't moved from his position, seemingly disinterested in the exchange. Then Teide glances towards Arec, who gives him a subtle nod of approval. She trusts his judgment, but he knows she values their safety above all.

Teide (sighing): "Alright, you can rest here until you’re able to move. But don’t get any ideas—if you cause any trouble, you’ll regret it." His tone is calm but carries an unmistakable edge.

The merchant nods weakly, his eyes wide. "I swear, I won’t cause any trouble. I just... need a little time."

Teide stands up and gestures for the merchant to sit closer to the fire. "Stay where I can see you," he says, his tone softer but still firm. He then takes a seat across from the merchant, keeping his bow within arm's reach.

Teide (glancing at Arec and then back at the merchant): "You’re lucky, you know. Arec doesn’t usually bother with outsiders. If it were up to El'roso, you’d probably be left to fend for yourself."

The merchant shivers slightly, his eyes darting towards El'roso, who remains engrossed in his spellbook, oblivious or uncaring of the conversation.

Merchant: "I... I’m grateful. Truly. I won’t forget this."

Teide leans back, his eyes never leaving the merchant. "Good. Just remember, gratitude doesn’t buy you trust. You rest, and by morning, you’d better be ready to move on."

The merchant nods, his body visibly relaxing as he leans closer to the warmth of the fire. Teide watches him for a moment longer before shifting his gaze to the surrounding darkness, his instincts still on high alert.

Arec glances over from where she’s sitting with Rudish, her eyes meeting Teide’s briefly. There’s a silent exchange—a look of understanding. She trusts him to handle the situation, and he knows it. He gives her a small nod, then returns his gaze to the merchant.

Teide (muttering to himself, barely audible): "Let’s hope you’re not more trouble than you’re worth."

The night progresses, and the merchant seems to settle down by the fire, eating some rations Teide reluctantly handed him. As the merchant regains some of his composure, Teide begins to subtly interrogate him, his questions seemingly casual but calculated.

**Teide**: "So, what were you doing out here alone? Not the safest route for a merchant."

**Merchant** (still somewhat shaken): "I... I was transporting some goods. Took a shortcut through the old roads. I didn't think bandits would be this far out."

Teide nods, his expression neutral. "What kind of goods? Anything worth much?"

The merchant shifts slightly, looking into the fire. "Mostly supplies... some fabrics, spices. Nothing too valuable, really."

Teide continues, his eyes fixed on the merchant. "And where were you headed?"

**Merchant**: "To Black..." He catches himself, his eyes widening slightly as he realizes that what he was about to say might have been a mistake, not knowing enough about the group's intentions or motives.

Teide’s gaze sharpens. "Black?" he prompts, his voice deceptively calm. "Go on. Where exactly were you headed?"

The merchant swallows, visibly nervous now. "I mean... I was... it was just a place nearby. Not important."

Teide leans forward, his eyes locking onto the merchant’s. "Nearby?" he sighs, as if disappointed in the merchant's lack of self-preservation. "There aren’t many places around here that start with 'Black.' You mean Black Hollow, don’t you?"

The merchant’s face pales, and he stammers, "No... no, it’s not like that. I just... I made some deliveries there, but I’m not one of them, I swear."

Teide’s expression hardens, and the atmosphere around the campfire shifts. Arec looks up, exchanging a concerned look with Teide. Rudish, sensing the tension, straightens slightly, his gaze moving to El'roso as if awaiting a command.

Arec sends an empathetic, concerned look towards the merchant, then glances at El'roso, noticing how Rudish has entered a familiar state of readiness.

Teide, apathetic yet acknowledging the situation, doesn’t answer immediately, his eyes still fixed on the merchant. Finally, he says what needs to be said, "He knows too much. If he’s been to Black Hollow, he knows who runs it."

The merchant raises his hands defensively. "Please! I won’t say anything. I didn’t mean to... I just..."

Before the merchant can finish, El'roso looks up from his spellbook, his expression one of mild annoyance. Without a word, he raises his hand, arcane energy crackling around his fingers.

Arec’s eyes widen, and she stands abruptly. "El'roso, wait!" she calls out, her voice firm, but there’s no hesitation in El'roso’s movements.

A pulse of energy shoots from El'roso's hand, striking the merchant square in the chest. The man gasps, his eyes wide with shock, before collapsing, lifeless, to the ground.

Silence falls over the camp, the crackling of the fire the only sound. Teide looks down at the merchant’s body, his expression hard but resigned. He glances at Arec, who stands there, her face a mask of controlled emotion.

**Arec** (quietly, to El'roso): "You could have let us handle it differently."

El'roso shrugs, already turning his attention back to his spellbook. "Hmm, I guess you're right."

Teide exhales, shaking his head. He meets Arec’s eyes, a silent understanding passing between them—this was the kind of harsh reality they had to deal with, traveling with someone like El'roso.

**Teide** (to Arec, his voice low): "I’ll take care of the body."

Arec nods, her expression softening slightly as she looks back at Rudish, who has been watching quietly. She moves to sit beside him again, her hand resting gently on his shoulder, offering silent reassurance.

**Arec** (to Rudish, her voice gentle): "Rest now. It’s over."
