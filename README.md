Indedx.md is the start of the story.
scenario_arec_teide.txt is the first scenario written that is not part of the book thus far, it is meant to explain to my contributors who Arec And Teide are, and who they are in the group dynamic with Elroso and Ruddish.
Scenario2_ArecsAligment_aMemory is meant to be read with "Mercy Street - Peter Gabriel" playing in the foreground. This one is written as a screen scene, where there is no audiable dialouge, you hear the song, it should be nearnly perfectly matched with the text if read normally. Imagine hearing some sounds in addition, rain, an arrow flying, daggers working, muffled screams and thuds, until the end where the music fades out and Arecs reaction is in the foreground of the sound picutre. This sceene was made to explain how Arec, who is a good character, could accept Elrosos behaviour from sceene 1 regarding the merchant.
